## 🏗️ 1. What types of systems do large BTP companies use?

Big construction companies (like TGCC, SGTM, SOMAGEC, Yamed, JESA, etc.) usually rely on professional digital systems, including:

### ✅ A. ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning)

- These unify finance, HR, procurement, inventory, planning, equipment management.
- Common ERPs used in Morocco’s BTP sector:
- SAP ERP (most used by large industrial & construction groups)
- Microsoft Dynamics 365
- Oracle ERP
- Odoo ERP (Enterprise/Community) — very popular for mid-sized firms
- Sage X3 — widely used in Morocco for finance & logistics
- Infor ERP (LN / M3) — used by manufacturing & construction sectors

Large Moroccan groups often use SAP or Oracle.
Mid-size construction firms often use Odoo, Sage X3, or Dynamics.

###🧱 B. BTP-specific systems (Construction Management Software)

These tools manage projects, execution, pricing, planning, chantier monitoring, etc.

Common construction-focused software used in Morocco:

1. Primavera P6 (Oracle)

Used for planning, timeline, and scheduling

Very common for big projects and engineering offices

Required in many infrastructure tenders

2. Microsoft Project

Used for medium-size projects or project managers

Simpler than Primavera

3. AutoCAD / Revit / BIM systems

Architectural plans, 3D modeling

BIM adoption is increasing in large Moroccan companies

Used by engineering teams, architects, and site planners

4. BTP-specific ERP modules

Local or French systems popular in Morocco include:

Sage Batigest (French, used by SMEs)

Procore (international construction management SaaS)

Archipad / PlanRadar (site monitoring apps)

Priority Construction ERP

GMAO (maintenance systems) like CARL Source

Some Moroccan companies even develop custom internal digital systems.

🚧 C. Equipment & Fleet Management Systems

Large BTP companies have many machines: cranes, trucks, excavators, etc.
They use:

GMAO systems (maintenance management)

Fleet telematics (tracking, fuel, GPS)

IoT-based tools (for large companies)

📈 D. Financial, HR & Payroll systems

Typical systems used:

Sage Paie (Payroll)

Odoo HR

SAP HR

Oracle HRIS

Pointage & chantier attendance systems

🏢 Which type of companies use these systems?
1. Very large BTP companies (TGCC, SGTM, SOMAGEC, JESA, Travaux Hydrauliques, etc.)

They usually use:

SAP / Oracle / Dynamics (full ERP)

Primavera P6

BIM (Revit, Navisworks)

Full digital procurement systems

Internal custom BTP dashboards

2. Mid-size companies (150–1500 employees)

Often use:

Dynamics or Odoo

Sage X3

MS Project

Basic BTP software (Batigest, PlanRadar)

3. Small contractors (TPE/PME)

Often use:

Excel

Small accounting tools

Simpler construction apps

Sometimes no digital system at all

🧠 Why structured BTP companies use these systems

Because construction involves:

Managing hundreds of workers

Tracking materials, concrete, rebar, inventory

Managing machines & maintenance

Coordinating subcontractors

Ensuring cost control

Monitoring site progress (chantier)

Complying with quality & safety standards
